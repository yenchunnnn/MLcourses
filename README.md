# Machine Learning 2017 Spring at National Taiwan University
This course was instructed by [李宏毅(Hung-Yi Lee)](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php). 

I've seen all the YouTube videos of this course in 2022. It's very helpful if you'd like to get a better understanding of the basic knowledge of ML. I've written down some notes on the slides, but if you prefer cleaner class slides, all the information about this course can be found on the [course website](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2017-spring.php).
